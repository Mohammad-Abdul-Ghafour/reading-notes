### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a lightweight scripting or programming language that enables you to create dynamic behavior.

#### So what can it really do?
JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:
* Store useful values inside variables. for example:

`var name = "Mohammad"`
her we give the variable (name) a value of "Mohammad"
* Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. for example:
```
var favMusic = prompt("what is your favorite music?")
if(favMusic == "Arabic"){
}
else if (favMusic =="English"){

}
else if(favMusic =="Global"){

}
else{
  
}
```

her the user will enter his/her favorite music and with every choice he/she made will come with different response.

... And much more ...
