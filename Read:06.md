### What is CSS ?
CSS stands for cascading style sheets. In short, CSS is a design language that makes a website look more appealing.
Then CSS determines visual structure of website and works with HTML.

#### How Does CSS Work with HTML ?
A website can run without CSS, but it certainly isn’t pretty. CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.

#### What are the Benefits of CSS ?
1. **Faster Page Speed**

More code means slower page speed. And CSS enables you to use less code. CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply it to all occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML document.

2. **Better User Experience**

CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly formatting. When buttons and text are in logical places and well organized, user experience improves.

3. **Compatibility Across Devices**

Responsive web design matters. In today’s day and age, web pages must be fully visible and easily navigable on all devices. Whether mobile or tablet, desktop, or even smart TV, CSS combines with HTML to make responsive design possible.

and much more ....

#### CSS syntax
The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:

```
h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}
```
This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings (`<h1>`).
