# MARKDOWN LANGUAGE AND GITHUB PAGES
#### What is markdown language ?
Markdown language is coding language similar to HTML but it's more lightweight and easy to use.
It's only use easy symbol to style your website, for example this website is made in markdown language and I show you some of the symbol I used:
```
1. Headers symbol:
    # For the head 1 as <h1> tag in HTML
    ## For the head 2 as <h2> tag in HTML
    .
    .
    .
    ###### For the head 6 as <h6> tag in HTML
```
```
2. Ordered list:
    1. Item 1
    2. Item 2
    3. Item 3
        1. Item 3a
        2. Item 3b
    Note that for nested list we have to put 4 spaces before it.
```
```
3. Syntax highlighting symbol:
    ```
    I used this symbol to highlight my codes examples
    ```
```
And that's MARKDOWN LANGUAGE...
