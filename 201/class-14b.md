# What Google Learned About Teams
9 years ago, **`Google`** set out to find what makes the ‘perfect’ team — and what they found shocked other researchers.

Put five, eight, 12 or more people together in a room, and it’s a crapshoot as to how well they’ll function as a team. The larger the group, the more difficult it becomes.

That’s exactly what **`Google`** wanted to learn in 2012, when it embarked on a quest to discover how to build the “perfect team.” The experiment, led by Abeer Dubey, a manager in **`Google`**’s People Analytics division, was called “Project Aristotle.”

## The key characteristics of enhanced teams :
After years of analyzing data and interviews from more than 180 teams across the company, Google found that the kinds of people (a.k.a. the individual personalities) in a team are not so relevant.
```
"We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter."
```
 Dubey said in an interview with The New York Times.

Instead, the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:
1. **`Psychological safety`** : 
    * Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
2. **`Dependability`** :
    * Everyone completes quality work on time.
3. **`Structure and clarity`** :
    * Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.
4. **`Meaning`** :
    * Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).
5. **`Impact`** :
    * Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.

The behaviors that create psychological safety conversational turn-taking and empathy are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more.

```
"As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined."
```
