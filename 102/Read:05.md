# OPERATORS IN JS
### What is operators?
An operator is capable of manipulating a certain value or operand. Operators are used to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands.

 In JavaScript operators are used for compare values, perform arithmetic operations etc. JavaScript has the following types of operators:

* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Arithmetic operators
* Bitwise operators
* Logical operators
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
* Relational operators

And there i will leave for you a table with the most important operators:

# LOOPS & ITERATION IN JS
### What is Loops?
Loops allow programs to perform repetitive tasks, such as iterating through an array. They come in handy when you want to execute a function a number of times, using different sets of inputs each time.

There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.

The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

* for statement
* do...while statement
* while statement
* labeled statement
* break statement
* continue statement
* for...in statement
* for...of statement

But the most used loops are:
