## Whiteboard Advices

In every whiteboard interview there are some steps that help you and keep you focus and confident:

1. First you have to restate the problem domain with your interviewer:
   * Rephrase the problem to the interviewer to make sure that you have understanded the problem.

2. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output.

3. Ask the interviewer about edge cases:
   * Think about potential edge cases to the problem and ask the interviewer what he/she want you to do with those edge cases.

4. Start visualize an example:
   * Give an example and visualize the logical process to get the expected output.

5. Write the algorithm:
   * Write down the algorithm of how you are going to solve the problem step by step.

6. Ask the interviewer if he/she have any questions before you jump to the codeing part.

7. Write Pseudocode:
   * Let the interviewer know you are going to start by writing pseudocode and write the actual code later.

8. Translate your pseudocode to actual code:
   * You should now start converting your pseudocode into actual code and don’t hesitate to ask if your solution looks good.

9. Now you should trace you code and calculate the Big O.

10. Last thing you should keep in your mind to keep explaining every step and communicate with your interviewer and don't say "*`I don't know`*".

## Bounce tips:

* **`Be enthusiastic`** : Enthusiasm has a huge impact on interview results. About 50% of the Triplebyte candidates who fail interviews at companies fail for non-technical reasons.

* **`Study common interview concepts`** : A large percentage of interview questions feature data structures and algorithms.
  * Hash tables
  * Linked lists
  * Breadth-first search, depth-first search
  * Quicksort, merge sort
  * Binary search
  * 2D arrays
  * Dynamic arrays
  * Binary search trees
  * Dynamic programming
  * Big-O analysis

* **`Get help from your interviewer`** : Interviewers help candidates they give hints, they respond to ideas, and they generally guide the process. The steps I recommend are:

1. Ask questions
2. Talk through a brute-force solution
3. Talk through an optimized solution
4. Write code

* **`Highlight results`** : The third type of question you may encounter is the experience question. This is where the interviewer asks you to talk about a programming project that you completed in the past.

* **`Practice, practice, practice`** : You can get much better at interviewing by practicing answering questions. This is true because interviews are stressful, but stress harms performance.

* **`Mention credentials`** : Credentials bias interviewers. Triplebyte candidates who have worked at a top company or studied at a top school go on to pass interviews at a 30% higher rate than programmers who don’t have these credentials.
