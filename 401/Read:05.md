# Linked Lists

* A way to organize the data
* The node have the data of the link.
* For traversal : can't use *`forEach`* or *`for`* because *`next`* property does that, use 'while'.
```
A node only knows about what data it contains, and who its neighbor is.

## Linked Lists and Big O :

Linked Lists  | Big O
---------|---------
insert a new node at the beginning | O(1)
insert a new node at the end or the middle | O(n) because it has toloop through all list
Searching for a value | O(n) for time, O(1) for space
