**`Web scraping`** is the process of collecting and parsing raw data from the Web, and the Python community has come up with some pretty powerful web scraping tools.

The Internet hosts perhaps the greatest source of information—and misinformation—on the planet.

Many disciplines, such as data science, business intelligence, and investigative reporting, can benefit enormously from collecting and analyzing data from websites.

## Important notes about web scraping :

1. Read through the website’s Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data. Most sites prohibit you from using the data for commercial purposes.
2. Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. You may potentially be blocked from the site as well.

## Why Python is used for web scraping ?

Large Collection of Libraries: Python has a huge collection of libraries such as Numpy, Matlplotlib, Pandas etc., which provides methods and services for various purposes.

Hence, it is suitable for web scraping and for further manipulation of extracted data.

## Techniques :

1. **`Human copy-and-paste`**
2. **`Text pattern matching`**
3. **`HTTP programming`**
4. **`HTML parsing`**
5. **`DOM parsing`**
6. **`Vertical aggregation`**
7. **`Semantic annotation recognizing`**
8. **`Computer vision web-page analysis`**
