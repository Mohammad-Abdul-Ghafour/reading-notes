# Linear Regressions

## What is Linear Regressions?
* Linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.
* It is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning

## Why use Linear Regression:
*  used for predictive analysis and modeling
* used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. 
* used to find a relationship between one or more features(independent variables) and a continuous target variable(dependent variable)

## Dependent variable vs Independent variable:

* The independent variable is the variable the experimenter manipulates or changes, and is assumed to have a direct effect on the dependent variable.
* The dependent variable is the variable being tested and measured in an experiment, and is 'dependent' on the independent variable.
