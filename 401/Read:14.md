# Matplotlib
## What is matplotlib ?

* **`Matplotlib.pyplot`** is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB.
* Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure:
   * Examples, creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.
* It is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy.
* As such, it offers a viable open source alternative to MATLAB.
* Developers can also use matplotlib's APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to embed plots in GUI applications.

## When to use matplotlib ?

* We use Matplotlib interactively from the python shell and have plotting windows pop up when they type commands.
* To run Jupyter notebooks and draw inline plots for quick data analysis.
* To embed Matplotlib into graphical user interfaces like PyQt or PyGObject to build rich applications.
* It is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays, and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack.
* It was conceived by John Hunter in 2002, originally as a patch to IPython for enabling interactive MATLAB-style plotting via gnuplot from the IPython command line.

## What is Seaborn ?
* **`Seaborn`** is an open-source Python library built on top of matplotlib.
* It is used for data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
* It works easily with dataframes and the Pandas library.
* The graphs created can also be customized easily.

## Seaborn vs. Matplotlib

* **`Matplotlib`** : Matplotlib is mainly deployed for basic plotting. Visualization using Matplotlib generally consists of bars, pies, lines, scatter plots and so on.
* **`Seaborn`** : Seaborn, on the other hand, provides a variety of visualization patterns. It uses fewer syntax and has easily interesting default themes.
