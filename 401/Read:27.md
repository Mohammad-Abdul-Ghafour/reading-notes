## Using JWT with Rest framework:
```
from django.urls import path, include
from rest_framework_simplejwt import views as jwt_views

urlpatterns = [
	path('api/token/',
		jwt_views.TokenObtainPairView.as_view(),
		name ='token_obtain_pair'),
	path('api/token/refresh/',
		jwt_views.TokenRefreshView.as_view(),
		name ='token_refresh'),
	path('', include('app.urls')),
]

```
