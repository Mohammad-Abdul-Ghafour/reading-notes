**`Machine learning`** is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

## Data Science :

**`Data Science`** is the area of study which involves extracting insights from vast amounts of data by the use of various scientific methods, algorithms, and processes.

It helps you to discover hidden patterns from the raw data.

The term Data Science has emerged because of the evolution of mathematical statistics, data analysis, and big data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis :

**`Exploratory Data Analysis`** (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics.

It is used to understand data, get some context regarding it, understand the variables and the relationships between them, and formulate hypotheses that could be useful when building predictive models.

Following things are part of EDA :

1. Get maximum insights from a data set
2. Uncover underlying structure
3. Extract important variables from the dataset
4. Detect outliers and anomalies(if any)
5. Test underlying assumptions
6. Determine the optimal factor settings

## Data Cleaning :

**`Data cleaning`**is the process of identifying, deleting, and/or replacing inconsistent or incorrect information from the database.

This technique ensures high quality of processed data and minimizes the risk of wrong or inaccurate conclusions.

As such, it is the foundational part of data science.

The standard data cleaning process consists of the following stages :

* Importing Data
* Merging data sets
* Rebuilding missing data
* Standardization
* Normalization
* Deduplication
* Verification & enrichment
* Exporting data

## Feature Engineering :

**`Feature engineering`** is the addition and construction of additional variables, or features, to your dataset to improve machine learning model performance and accuracy.

The most effective feature engineering is based on sound knowledge of the business problem and your available data sources.

## Algorithm Selection :

In machine learning, **`algorithm selection`** is better known as meta-learning.

The portfolio of algorithms consists of machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, DNN), the instances are data sets and the cost metric is for example the error rate.

## Model training :

**`Model training`** is the phase in the data science development lifecycle where practitioners try to fit the best combination of weights and bias to a machine learning algorithm to minimize a loss function over the prediction range.
