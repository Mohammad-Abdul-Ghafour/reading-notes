### JSX:
* a syntax extension to JavaScript. 
* Describe the look of the UI.
* Not a requirement to use it with react but it is helpful.
* Write JSX inside parentheses (JSX) to aviod writing ";".
* JSX  Attributes:
  - "" : for string values.
  - {} : for JavaScript expression.
  - JSX uses camelCase attributes names, `class` in HTML becomes `className` in React.

### JS vs JSX:
> **JS** is standard javascript, **JSX** is an HTML-like syntax that you can use with React to (theoretically) make it easier and more intuitive to create React components.

### Rendering Elements and Components:
* Elements in React are the smallest building block, they describe what you want to see in the screen.
* Elements are Objects
* Elements are immutable.
* Components are made of elements.
* Component is similar to JavaScript functions where it takes Props as input, and get elements as output, `properties -> component -> element`.
* Component names with a capital letter.

### React Concepts:
* `setState()`: used to change the state of the component as we can't modify directly the start property because it is mutable. used with stateful components.
* Handling Events: 
  - `onClick={functionName}`
  - `onChange={functionName}`
  - `onSubmit={functionName}`
