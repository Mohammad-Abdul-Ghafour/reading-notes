# Pandas
## What is Pandas ?
**`Pandas`** is a Python library used for working with data sets.

It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

**`Pandas`** allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories, can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.

**`Pandas`** gives you answers about the data. Like:

* Is there a correlation between two or more columns?
* What is average value?
* Max value?
* Min value?
